This code converts a video (or individual images) into Ascii art. The resolution can be changed, and the video can be compressed if needed, as the videos require a large amount of space. 

Works best when the variable 'frame_reduction' is a divisor of the frames per second (fps), or close to a divisor [fps % frame_reduction should be minimised]
